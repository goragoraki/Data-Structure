# Data Structure with c++
The goal is to familiarize with using Data Structure.  
Understand the concepts of the Data Structure by **implementing data structures in STL**.  
And Solve various problems through data structures implemented by myself.

All code has comments(English).  
See more details of code or data structure explanation, visit [my blog](https://hagisilecoding.tistory.com/category/CS/%EC%9E%90%EB%A3%8C%EA%B5%AC%EC%A1%B0).  
There are explanations of Data Structure (korean).

*main.cpp is the file that uses each topic.

## Outline
1. List  
2. Stack  
3. Queue

### 1. List  
Part 1. unsorted List.  
> ItemType.cpp - Implementation file for items on the list.  
> ItemType.h - Specification for items on the list.  
> unsorted.cpp - Implementation file for UnsortedType class.  
> unsorted.h - Specification file for UnsortedType class.  
> main.cpp - If you enter a negative number, delete the same absolute value in the list.
