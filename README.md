# Data Structure with c++
The goal is to familiarize with using Data Structure.  
Understand the basic concepts of the Data Structure by making for the data structure.  

All code has comments(English).  
See more details of code or data structure explanation, visit [my blog](https://hagisilecoding.tistory.com/category/CS/%EC%9E%90%EB%A3%8C%EA%B5%AC%EC%A1%B0).  
There are explanations of Data Structure (korean).

*main.cpp is the file that uses each topic.
